This is a personal website to show off my projects and experience in the field.

## License Choice

I chose the AGPL-3.0 License because it is one of the least generous Open Source Software (Oss) Licenses.

It forces anybody that uses my code to also open source their changes. This even applies to when it is being run on a server. Because of this nobody can modify my code and then put it behind a paywall for others to use.
It also forces companies to share their code even if they are just using it within their company.
