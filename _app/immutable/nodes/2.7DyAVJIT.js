            I am currently a student attending Simon Fraser University with my projected graduation being in 2028.
            Though my major is Computer Science as a whole it is specifically software development that I am interested
            in pursuing. <br> <br> Another part of computer science that interests me is the world of AI. I know, I know, everybody is interested
            in AI now but that has been my dream since I first learned what it was. <br> <br> My dream is to create software that benefits everyone. Software that is accessible and useful for everybody, no matter
            how much money they have. Because of this I am very interested in Open Source Software. In my ideal world every piece
            of software would be open source allowing everybody to innovate and benefit from it. <br> <br> Outside the world of computer science I am also an amateur singer/songwriter. I spend a lot of my free time 
            messing around on both the piano and guitar trying to come up with my next catchy melody to put in a song. Also,
            I love to hike! That's where that image up above comes from. Now, <b>BEFORE</b> you judge how I look I would just like to
            mention that it was <b>VERY</b> cold outside and my face wouldn't let me smile. Trust me, my smile is actually quite normal
            when I'm a normal temperature.</p></div></div>`);function j(r){var e=g(),s=t(e),o=t(s),n=t(o);b(n,{color:"#0496FF"}),a(o);var m=i(o,2);f(m),a(s);var d=i(s,2),h=t(d);u(h,"src",`${y??""}/my-photo.jpeg`),l(4),a(d),a(e),v(r,e)}export{j as component};
